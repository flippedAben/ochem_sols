# Solutions to Organic Chemistry

## Setup

I want to use pretty format where I can. Hence, I'm writing in Jupyter notebooks.

I had to install `conda` because it's the easiest way to install `rdkit`. To do
so, install Miniconda from [this page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Then,

```bash
conda create -n ochem_solutions_env
conda activate ochem_solutions_env

# install rdkit from the rdkit channel
conda install -c rdkit rdkit

# Get a Jupyter notebook
conda install jupyter
```
